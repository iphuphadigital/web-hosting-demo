# Static Site Demo

The static site aims to demonstrate that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code will always remain the same and never change, hence static. It is important to note that static sites are only static in terms of the source code returned from the server. The site itself is still interactive and dynamic through the use of JavaScript on the client-side. You can see this by how the JavaScript generates a new favourite number whenever the button is clicked.

Static does NOT mean that the page never changes - it's just pre-built during development.

## Getting Started

To run this site, just open the index.html file with your favourite browser.
