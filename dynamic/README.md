# Dynamic Site Demo

The dynamic site aims to demonstrate that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code will not remain the same and sometimes change, hence dynamic. It is important to note that dynamic sites are only dynamic in terms of the source code returned from the server. The site itself is still interactive and dynamic through the use of JavaScript on the client-side. You can see this by how the JavaScript generates a new favourite number whenever the button is clicked. But unlike the static site demo, the new number is generated on the server-side through a different HTML page. This is why a page reload is required everytime a new number has to be generated.

Dynamic does NOT mean that there's no HTML page being serverd - it's just built dynamically for each request.

To run this site, follow the steps below.

1. Run `npm install` from the dynamic folder.
