# Hosting Demo (Static vs Dynamic)

Dear developer, this demo serves to provide an interactive demonstration of the nuance differences between statically and dynamically hosted websites. Therefore, this is a companion repository to a [blog article](https://iphupha.co.za/blog/web-hosting-a-modern-secure-fast-and-affordable-approach) that goes further into details explaining the different kinds of hosting and when and how to choose the correct hosting for your needs.

## Getting Started

There are 2 folders, dynamic and static, that each contain a website. As the folder name has depicted, you will find the dynamic site under the dynamic folder and the static site under the static folder. For more information on setting up and running each site locally, please view the readme located at the root of each of the 2 folders.
